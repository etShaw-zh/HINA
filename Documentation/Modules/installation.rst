**Testing and Continuous Integration**

*HINA* is equipped with automated testing on GitHub Actions to ensure that all functionalities work as expected. As part of CI/CD pipeline, this process helps maintain code quality and quickly catches any issues.

To run the tests manually, users need to clone the *HINA* GitHub repository.

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the *HINA* GitHub repository to access the `Tests` folder.

   .. code-block:: console

       git clone https://github.com/baiyueh/HINA.git
       cd HINA

2. **Install the Required Packages**: Ensure all dependencies, including `pytest`, are installed by running the following commands:

   .. code-block:: console

       pip install -r requirements.txt
       pip install hina
       pip install pytest

3. **Run the Tests**: Use `pytest` to execute all tests cases in the `HINA` folder.

   .. code-block:: console

       pytest hina/ 

4. **View the Results**: The output will display any failed tests and provide detailed information on each failed test case.

GitHub Actions runs these tests automatically with the latest stable versions of Python and relevant dependencies each time code is pushed to the repository or a pull request is made. For more information about workflows runs, see `Workflows <https://github.com/baiyueh/HINA/actions>`_ in the repository.
